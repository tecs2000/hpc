Case: Consider this example of PRIVATE and FIRSTPRIVATE

variables: A = 1, B = 1, C = 1
#pragma omp parallel private(B) firstprivate(C)

Questions:
1) Are A, B, C local to each thread or shared inside the parallel region?
-> A uninitialized private copy of B is created for each thread. A is shared, and C is private, or local, to each thread but with a initial value of 1.

2) What are their initial values inside and values after the parallel region?
-> A init. value will be 1. B init. value will be undefined. And C init. value will be 1. After, A will contain whichever last value it received inside the parallel region or 1. B will remain 1. And C will also contain 1.
